NetCDF notes: EDS220 notes! 

Dimensions: lat and longitude! 
Time and date!!
- time indicates when measurement happened when can ecocide it as dates
- pairs of lat and long values indicate position of weather stations 

30N 60E and measured at every 10degree north and every 10 easthg

Variables: air temperature, represented as a 5 x 5 x 3 array with constant values for each day

attributes: CRS, F or C, station ID

Col: longitude
Row: latitude 


Adding anew variable: average temp data 
variables: temperature and average temperature. Temp data stays same can represent average temp as a single 5x5 array with value 1 at each cell 
attribues: 
dimensions: time will change, cut off averaging across times to get a single value (shorten), still has 3 dimensions time lat and long 
- temp variable using all three temp

- Variables in same dataset my have all some uno dimensions in common 
- Datasets dimensions are union of dimensions of all variables in the data set 
- can add a fourth dimensions such as elevetion (lat,long,elevation,tiem) 
- temp variable uses all 3 dimensions adn average temp variable only uses two 

attributes: 
- keep all previous attribtues and add attribtues forr our new average temp variable 

Coordiantes: 
- variables-  N dimensional arrays of numbers, what is measured? varying measured dependent quanitites? 
    - we measure temp 

- dimensions- desrib the axes of the arrays, with respect to what are we measuring variable., csontant/fixed.independent quantities at which we measure the variable (we temp with respect to time lat and longm 

- coordinates: coord depend ond imensiosn buta re separate eat dimensions has a set of coordinates, coordinate sindicate dimensions values , at which points in dimensiosn are we measuring the variable 
    - measure temp variable at 60,70 degrres along longtideud dimension
